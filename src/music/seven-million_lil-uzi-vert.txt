 Lyrics:

You see I'm drippin' in baguettes, hey
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see me drippin' doin' the flex, hey
(T-T-T-T-Trenchwerk)

You see me flexin' on your bitch, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' on your bitch, you can't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm flexin' on your bitch, hey
You see I'm flexin' VVSs, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, they can't forget about me
You know I'm flexin' on a bitch, hey
You know I'm flexin' on your clique
Say

Girl, you're cool but you know, I could find a better you
Feelings ain't changed but you might need somethin' new
Yeah, might need a better dude
Louis Vuitton, the Gabbana, Prada, the better shoes

Put my pedal to the floor
Uh, yeah, make it roar
Pull up, skrrt, 'Ventador
Jump out, uh, lift my door

And that bitch kinda hard to handle
Chop it, flip it, move it out the bando
Pull up in a Bentley, foreign cars are random
Matter of fact, I probably want the Phantom, yeah

You see me flexin' on your bitch, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' on your bitch, you can't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm flexin' on your bitch, hey
You see I'm flexin' VVSs, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, they can't forget about me
You know I'm flexin' on a bitch, hey
You know I'm flexin' on your clique
Say

Put my pedal to the floor
Uh, yeah, make it roar
Pull up, skrrt, 'Ventador
Jump out, uh, lift my door

Know I'm flexin' on your clique
Blink of a eye, know that I would take your bitch
I cannot lie, I cannot live life like this
'Cause if I lie then I know it is not real, yeah
You can't forget
Baby, please, don't forget about me
Yeah, she saw my Rollie won't forget about me
Addicted to my flexin', now can't live without me

You see me flexin' on your bitch, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' on your bitch, you can't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm flexin' on your bitch, hey
You see I'm flexin' VVSs, don't forget about me
You see I'm drippin' VVS, they can't forget about me
You know I'm flexin' on a bitch, hey
You know I'm flexin' on your clique
Say

You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm drippin' them baguettes, hey
You see I'm drippin' VVS, hey
You see I'm drippin' them baguettes, hey
