Habits of My Heart
 by Jaymes Young
 in Habits of My Heart

 Lyrics:

I can't, say no
It's ripping me apart

In a dark room, in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself between your legs
Your medicine is in my head

You know I'd rather be alone, yeah
But then you call me on the phone

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

I tell myself "I like that"
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can fuck yourself

'Cause I'd rather be alone
But you fermented in my bones

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close...
