 Lyrics:

Got me like hold up, wait a minute
Body so banging got me feeling like a menace
Soon as she stepped in the club you could see it
Show stopper put the spotlight on it, whoa
Have you seen her?
That pretty brown skin walk so mean, ah-whoa
In her own league cause them other girls in here can't keep u, no

I told her by the end of the night
Imma have her in my hotel room
Shots of patron get her right
She sparked up a joint that means we're leaving soon
By the end of the night
Might fuck around and make a baby with you
Them drinks got us right
Let me call a uber cause we leaving soon

Your body's a killer, post a picture don't need no filter
It's all real ain't gotta see no doctor
It's so real don't need no doctor, no
Have you seen her?
Come on tell me, have you seen her it's like, whoa?
Have you seen her?
Everytime I see her I'm like, whoa

I told her by the end of the night
Imma have her in my hotel room
Shots of patron get her right
She sparked up a joint that means we're leaving soon
By the end of the night
Might fuck around and make a baby with you
Them drinks got us right
Let me call a uber cause we leaving soon

And the beat go
And the beat go

You give me that feeling baby
That shit that drives me crazy
You give me that feeling baby
That shit that drives me crazy

Got me like hold up wait a minute
That booty let me get all in it
Hold up, wait a minute, bring it over here let me get in, whoa
Wait a minute that booty let me get all in like, whoa
Come here let me get all in like, whoa
