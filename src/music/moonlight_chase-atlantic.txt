Moonlight

 Lyrics:

Busy on the weekend
Caught up in your own small world
Well, I might wanna see it then
Call it hesitation, girl

We're running in the moonlight
We're dancing in the open waves
You're hangin' for a good time
Something that'll make you stay

And girl, you fall down again
You tell me you're all out again
We're running in the moonlight
Could you show me the way again?
Oh, no, no

You're talking in and out of the subject
Just call me when you're finished, are you done yet, girl?
You're falling in and out through a sunset
And I just wanna know if you're in love yet girl

She just wants to talk through the daytime
And I just want it all when the time's right
Yeah, she's about to fall for the third time
The nature of it all

Busy on the weekend
Caught up in your own small world
Well, I might wanna see it then
Call it hesitation, girl

We're running in the moonlight
We're dancing in the open waves
You're hangin' for a good time
Something that'll make you stay

And girl, you fall down again
You tell me you're all out again
We're running in the moonlight
Could you show me the way again?
Oh, no, no

We're diving through the bottom of the ocean
Swimming through a bottle of emotions, girl
Maybe I was thinking you would notice
I was runnin' through the forest when I wrote this, girl

And she just wants to talk through the daytime
And I just want it all when the time's right
Yeah, she's about to fall for the third time
The nature of it all

Busy on the weekend
Caught up in your own small world
Well, I might wanna see it then
Call it hesitation, girl

We're running in the moonlight
We're dancing in the open waves
You're hangin' for a good time
Something that'll make you stay

And girl, you fall down again
You tell me you're all out again
We're running in the moonlight
Could you show me the way again?
Oh, no, no
