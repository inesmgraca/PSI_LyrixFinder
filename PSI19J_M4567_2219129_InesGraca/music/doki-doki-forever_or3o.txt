 Lyrics:

Doki, doki!

Hey, hey
My heart's beating when I'm hanging out with you
Why does my heart ache
When I hear you feel the same way too?
Just like a sundae
It's sweet every time I teach you something new
Is this by chance or fate
Whenever it's just me and you?
Don't get the wrong idea!

When we touch
It'll never be enough
Is it way too much
If you had to choose just one of us?

Tell me, tell me, please
Is this what I think or is it just me?
Don't wake me up from this sweet little dream
Where we'll be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart
Will it be okay?
If I express my love for you this way?
No matter what you do or what you say
Where we'll be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart
(We're never gonna be apart)

Hey, hey
When I'm next to you, I don't know what to do
Why does it feel so great
When our eyes meet out of the blue?
I'm sorry, I said too much!
I really love the way you write even when you don't have a clue
I wanna hear you say
"This love that I am feeling is true"

Tasty love
Something I want more of
Will it make the cut
If you had to choose just one of us?

Shall I leave you be?
Is it love if I can set you free?
But even if it's not reality
Let's be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart
How can I convey
My love for you before they fly away?
I think about it all day everyday
We'll be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart

One by one
They only fall apart
Can it be undone?
Why can't I just be the one for once?
We’ll be together, foreverWe’re never gonna be apart
Maybe, we’ll never be together
But forever, you’ll be in my heart
