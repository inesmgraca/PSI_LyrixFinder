Worst in Me
 by Unlike Pluto
 in Worst in Me

 Lyrics:

I saw you standing there and I knew
I'm done for, it's over, I'm through
Playing games from the start
Sinking your nails in my heart

You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me

Looking back in my rear view
Nothing, no nothing can change you, no
I decided to play when I knew you were fire
It started off warm but now I hear the choir
Who do you think you are
Leaving your keys in my car

You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me

You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst in me
