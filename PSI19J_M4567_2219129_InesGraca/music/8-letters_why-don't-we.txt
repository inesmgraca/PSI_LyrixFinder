 Lyrics:

You know me the best
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
That, right there, is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling

I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?

Isn't it amazing
How almost every line
On our hands align
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again
Isn't that a sign?
I should speak my mind

I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say? (Woah, oh yeah)

When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind
When I close my eyes

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?

If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (It's only you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (You)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
