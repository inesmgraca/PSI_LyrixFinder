 Lyrics:

We packin' diamond pistols

We eatin' good (Yeah?), I'm a fat man (Uh)
Faded, chewin' drugs like Pac-Man (Chump)
TMG (Uh) on your Walkman (Ooh)
You ain't fuckin' wit' it
You can take a walk, man (Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Nah)
Yuh, ayy

Shorty jumpin' in the front row (Whoo)
I put her face on my wood like a totem pole (Goddamn)
My lids low from the blunt smoke (Shit)
Feelin' RnB holdin' blue notes
Boy, you only bussin' down with a fuckin' bus pass (Bitch)
Smacking your girlie's box, she a Camel pack (Whoo)
Touching her endzone and we gon' run it back
Fingers all over my quarter pounder and she lovin' that

Uh, hi, babe? We just made a song
And I'm rapping about other girls
And I was just wondering if-
Yeah, I know it's just- It's- yeah, it's ok?
Alright, cool guys
Print it, it's good
She said it's alright

We eatin' good (Yeah?), I'm a fat man (Uh)
Faded, chewin' drugs like Pac-Man (Chump)
TMG (Uh) on your Walkman (Ooh)
You ain't fuckin' wit' it
You can take a walk, man (Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Nah)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Nah)

I'm in Topanga like I'm Cory M (Vroom)
Drunk switchin' lanes, like I'm sorry, man (Urrh)
Stole your bitch, was a breeze, she a super-fan (Phew)
She a ho, 'cause she's fuckin' with my farmers tan (Yeah yeah yeah)
Run your mouth, boy, you can take a hike (Take a hike)
Gloves off bitch, I'm feelin' impolite (Get lost)
I got this chick and she like to cook me dinner (Yup)
Might bust down her ring finger (Hahahaha)

Hey, babe, so, uh, I'm making a song right now
And I am rapping about other girls
But I ended it by saying I was gonna propose to you
Is that cool? It is? Ho-ho-ho, yes!

We eating good (Yeah?), I'm a fat man (Uh)
Faded, chewin' drugs like Pac-Man (Chump)
TMG (Uh) on your Walkman (Ooh)
You ain't fuckin' wit' it
You can take a walk, man (Walk, walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Nah)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Walk, walk, walk)
Take a walk (Ayy), take a walk (Yuh)
You don't wanna push my buttons, take a walk (Nah)
