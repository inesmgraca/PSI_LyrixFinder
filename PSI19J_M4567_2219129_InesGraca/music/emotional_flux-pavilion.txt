 Lyrics:

You are no good for me no more
We don’t know how to love without a war
We’re a disease without a cure
You wanna hurt just a little, hurt just a little more

We are casually cruel
You were my training wheels and april fools
But our tolerance is full
Don’t wanna hurt anybody, hurt anyone no more

Ain't this a pity, watching your pretty smile so warm
When I am already halfway out the door
And you’ll go and kiss me, say you were tipsy
Baby, I lose my cool
When I get emotional

I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional
I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional

You are detention after school
You are November in the swimming pool
A speeding car running on fumes
We can drive just a little, drive just a little more

You are a trampoline with wings
We’re only jumping out of tendency
Cause now we both need different things
So I’ll be cutting off these strings

Ain't this a pity, watching your pretty smile so warm
And I am already halfway out the door
And you’ll go and kiss me, say you were tipsy
Baby, I lose my cool
When I get emotional

I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional
I get emotional
You get emotional, too
I get emotional
We’re comfortably dysfunctional, I get emotional
