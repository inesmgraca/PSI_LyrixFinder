 Lyrics:

Do whatcha, do whatcha, do whatcha do
Do whatcha, do whatcha, do whatcha, do whatcha, do it
Remember shawty made a monkey on the dick?
But now I'm 'bout to make you throw such a fit
Remember shawty made a monkey on the dick?
But now I'm 'bout to make you throw such a fit
Now throw such a fit, now throw such a fit
Now throw such a fit, now throw such a fit
Now throw such a fit, now throw such a fit
Now do whatcha, do whatcha, do whatcha do
We got London on the track
My way

Get my platinum, I'ma empty out the ATM (ATM)
On the seat, no cap, and I don't play pretend (Facts)
One thousand, two thousand, three, gone (Poof)
If you ain't tryna suck dick, then be gone, uh
Hop out the Porsche, got in the 'Rari just to switch it up (Skrrt)
Zero to sixty, 2.8, I paddle shifted up
West Hollywood, little model, she got a nip and tuck (Facts)
Got her vagina rejuvenated, it's a different fuck (Bitch)
Me and London pullin' up in these Lambo trucks (That's a fact)
Spent ten thousand while you throw your little hundred bucks (Broke ass)
That really was a splurge? I mean you broke as fuck (Broke ass)
It's raining game, get a poncho, come and soak it up
Really, I mean for real, like where they do that?
In the Bay, we say, "Yee," in New Orleans, they say, "Who dat?"
I'm flagrant, I'm in lil' baby's ear like "Where your dude at?"
Just ordered chicken at Blue Flame I'm askin' where my food at (Bitch)

I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Got the club goin' crazy when I throw this
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Why you got your hands out? You can't hold this

I got two phones, one for my sugar daddy
Other for my shooter, he be trigger happy
Pussy real bald, it ain't never nappy
Got my own whip just to make me happy
Fuck another flip, spot a new Philippe
He gon' run it back, I'm his favorite freak
Yeah, don't step in my pussy, now he feelin' great
Fuck him once, fuck him twice, now we on streak
Late night in the Hills, fuck him on the street
Eat my pussy past 12, late night treat
What's her name? Yung Miami
Hood bitch, "Act Up" need a Grammy
My son come first, that's family
Somebody touch him, that's them life gambling
Real take the top off, no tan lines
Hate gets no reply, you a fan of mine
I should whoop your ass like a kid of mine
You don't like me? Bitch, go get in line (Period)

I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Got the club goin' crazy when I throw this
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Why you got your hands out? You can't hold this

She told me I just wanna fuck, I told her she a psychic
She asked me 'bout her friend, I said yeah I hit, but I ain't like it
I like my women like my crawfish, hot and spicy
You want to chill when I come over? Ho, then don't invite me
It's mister bounce back, spin and get it all back
Money good, but first you gotta empty out my ballsacks
I'm in a Lamborghini feelin' thirsty
Bitches who just wanna fuck with niggas who in first place
You lookin' at the best up in here, ain't no ultimatum
I never showed them niggas mercy, only God forgave 'em
We throwin' money in the air, we tryna touch the ceiling
Niggas keep lookin' and they can't get out they fuckin' feelings
Bounce it for a twenty, shake it for the fifty
Do it for a hundred, pay your bills with it (Pay your bills, baby)
Ain't no other dick, this the only dick
Now monkey on the dick, monkey on the dick

I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Got the club goin' crazy when I throw this
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
I'ma throw this money while they throw fits
Why you got your hands out? You can't hold this
