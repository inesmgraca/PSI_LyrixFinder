Deja Vu

 in Super Eurobeat Vol. 130

 Lyrics:

See your body into the moonlight
Even if I try to cancel
All the pictures into the mind
There's a flashing in my eyes

Don't you see my condition?
The fiction - is gonna run it again
Can't you see now illusions?
Right into your mind

Déjà vu
I've just been in this place before
Higher on the street
And I know it's my time to go
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, woah

Déjà vu
I've just been in this time before
Higher on the beat
And I know it's a place to go
Calling you and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah

See the future into the present
See my past leaves in the distance
Try to guess now what's going on
And the band begins to play

Don't you see my condition?
The fiction - is gonna run it again
Can't you see now illusions?
Right into your mind

Déjà vu
I've just been in this place before
Higher on the street
And I know it's my time to go
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, woah

Déjà vu
I've just been in this time before
Higher on the beat
And I know it's a place to go
Calling you and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah

See your body into the moonlight
Even if I try to cancel
All the pictures into the mind
There's a flashing in my eyes

Don’t you see my condition, the fiction
Has gone running again
Can't you see now, illusions
Right into your mind

Déjà vu
I've just been in this place before
Higher on the street
And I know it's my time to go
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, woah

Déjà vu
I've just been in this time before
Higher on the beat
And I know it's a place to go
Calling you and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah
