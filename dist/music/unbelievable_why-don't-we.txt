 Lyrics:

Hey, how did we, how did we
How did we end up at your place?
With my hands, with my hands
With my hands around your waist
Like you're too cool, cool
I don't believe that it's true, still
Your taste, I could drink, I could drink
I could drink a whole damn case
Every drip, every drip
Couldn't let you go to waste
When you're making those moves, eh
I don't know what to do, yeah

If it's all a dream, don't wake up
'Cause I got your body right here next to me, just wait up
Gotta check myself 'cause I just can't believe, ayy-oh
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, you are
Unbelievable, it's
Unbelievable
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable
Unbelievable, it's (Unbelievable now)
Unbelievable
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Hey, never thought, never thought
I'd be holding your hand
Picking up, picking up, picking up my confidence
When you're making those moves, eh (Those moves)
I don't know what to do, yeah (To do)

If it's all a dream, don't wake up
'Cause I got your body right here next to me, just wait up
Gotta check myself 'cause I just can't believe, ayy-oh
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, you are (Unbelievable)
Unbelievable, it's
Unbelievable (Unbelievable)
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah (Oh yeah)
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable
Unbelievable, it's (Unbelievable)
Unbelievable
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable
Unbelievable, yeah

Gotta check myself 'cause I just can't believe (Can't believe)
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable
Unbelievable, it's
Unbelievable that you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed

Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable, yeah (Oh)
Unbelievable, yeah
Unbelievable (Oh, no-no-no)
Unbelievable, it's
Unbelievable (Ayo)
That you were in my heart, you were in my head
Now you're waking up here in my bed
