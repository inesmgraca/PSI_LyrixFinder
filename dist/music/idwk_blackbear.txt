 Lyrics:

Every morning you wake up and you're reaching out for me
Found you someone you could have just temporarily
Everything you wanted, I knew every part about you
From your head to your toes, from your heart to your soul

And I don't wanna know
So why you gotta be that honest for?
I ain't hold your heart no more
Why you gotta make me insecure?

Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's loving you? Who's touching you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's texting you? (Goddamn, who?)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't wanna know right now

Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's loving you, you?
Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's texting you?
Who's sexting you?
Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know

Every morning I wake up a little richer, a little more alone
He got spots to find on his own, I found so long ago
Hope you don't cry no more
Why you gotta be so insecure?

Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's loving you? Who's touching you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's texting you? (Goddamn, who?)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't wanna know right now (Who's loving you?)

Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's loving you, you?
I don't wanna know
Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's texting you?
Who's sexting you?
Who's loving you?
Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's texting you?
Who's sexting you?
Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
(Who's loving you?)
