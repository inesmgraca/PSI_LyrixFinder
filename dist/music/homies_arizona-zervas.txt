 Lyrics:

Sorry girl, I gotta ghost
Yeah, you know this ain't the old me
Tried to keep it on the low
But we should probably just be homies

Yeah, I said I gotta ghost
Girl, don't act like you don't know me
I ain't tryna waste your time
So we should probably just be homies

This has gone on way too long
We need to break (to break)
Tried to keep it low but now you feel a way
A way about me (me, me)
Watcha say about me? (me, me)
Yeah, your friends keep talking, sayin that you're falling
But I don't really play [?]

I got too much on my mind
I got too much on my plate
And I don't wanna waste your time
So I think it's time to say, say

Sorry girl, I gotta ghost
Yeah, you know this ain't the old me
Tried to keep it on the low
But we should probably just be homies

Yeah, I said I gotta ghost
Girl, don't act like you don't know me
I ain't tryna waste your time
So we should probably just be homies

I don't feel the same way as I did
When we were flirting over text
We would split a bottle, hit the club
And come home lookin like a mess
Roommates started buggin' 'bout the noises
And the bruises on your neck
Everything was cool until you started catching
Feeling, getting stressed
And I ain't sayin' that you're wrong for it
But that just really ain't my vibe
Like girl, please
How can you expect for me to act like you ain't got one on the side?
Got me like

Sorry girl, I gotta ghost (Sorry girl, I gotta ghost)
Yeah, you know this ain't the old me
(Yeah, you know this ain't the old me)
Tried to keep it on the low (tried to keep it on the low)
But we should probably just be homies
(We should probably just be homies)

Yeah, I said I gotta ghost (Yeah, I said I gotta ghost)
Girl, don't act like you don't know me
(Girl, don't act like you don't know me)
I ain't tryna waste your time (I ain't tryna waste your time)
So we should probably just be homies
(So we shold probably just be homies

(Homies, homies, we should probably just be homies)
