 Lyrics:

Ahhh, ahhh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, oh, ahh
Ayy, ayy, ahh, ahh
Tadow
Ayy, ayy, ay, oh, ahh
Ayy, ayy, ahh, ahh
Tadow

Ooh, I saw her and she hit me like (Tadow)
Saw that thing so beautiful (Tadow)
She just hit my heart, ooh (Tadow)
Full force and she got me like (Tadow)

I be like (Tadow)
Baby (Tadow)
Why you so fine? (Tadow, tadow)
Gotta make you mine (Tadow, tadow)
So hard to find (Tadow, tadow)

Baby like oh
How'd you do the thing?
The way that you do it and she ain't even show
Nothing
She be walking round so confident, so heaven-sent
I think she was meant to knock 'em dead like (Tadow, tadow)

Like (Tadow, tadow)
Girl you so fine (Tadow)
Ohh (Tadow, tadow)
Girl, you acting like oh

She was so sublime
Super fine
She was never lying
Strutting in her heels
Or her slides either way
Eyes on her every single day, week, year
Everyone wondering how she does it with no fear
All that confidence wasn't heaven-sent
Does it come within?
Does it come run out?
I don't know
She'll just have 'em runnin'
Out and in man they want to sin
Talking deadly sin
With Mrs. Lady, I don't understand
Why she hit 'em like (Tadow, tadow)

Yeah, like (Tadow, tadow)
Girl, you knock 'em dead (Tadow, tadow)
Ohh (Tadow)
How you do it like you do it (Tadow, tadow)
Yeah yeah (Tadow, tadow)
Baby, you knock 'em dead (Tadow, tadow)
I love you so baby (Tadow, tadow)
Yeah, yeah, ohh

Tadow
