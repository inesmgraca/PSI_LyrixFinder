 Lyrics:

Oh, babe

I know you're tryna do you, but I heard you fell off
After a couple bad nights
And 20 cold hearts (Mmm)
Tryna find a new you, but I heard you got lost
Tryna figure your worth
What the hell does that cost?

(Ayy) When I'm kissing ya, grippin' ya thigh (Thigh)
I realized you were destined and meant to be mine (Mine)
But who am I to conflict wit' you livin' your life? (Life)
Just know when you call, I'm at the end of the line

I'll practice my patience
While you're getting wasted
'Til fate brings you home
I'll wait through your phases
You'll shuffle through faces
Like songs in your playlist
'Til fate brings you home (Home)
I'll wait through your phases, phases, oh (Hey)

Hittin' all the right cues and you're leaving your mark
But I know that ain't you (Ain't you)
You're just playing your part (Ha-ha), baby, uh
Tryna fit in them shoes, but you take it too far (Too far)
It doesn't matter where it takes you
I'll go wherever you are (Oh)

When I'm kissing ya, grippin' ya thigh (Your thigh)
I realized you were destined and meant to be mine (Meant to be mine, mine, yeah)
But who am I to conflict wit' you livin' your life? (Livin' your life)
Just know when you call, I'm at the end of the line (Oh-oh)

I'll practice my patience
While you're getting wasted
'Til fate brings you home
I'll wait through your phases (Phases)
You'll shuffle through faces
Like songs in your playlist
'Til fate brings you home (Home)
I'll wait through your phases, phases
I'll wait, I'll wait, oh

I'll wait, I'll wait through your phases, phases, oh (Hey)
I'll wait, I'll wait through your phases, phases, oh (Baby)
For you, I'll wait through your phases, phases (For you, baby)
I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait through your phases, oh (Yeah)

Yeah, I'm really tired of bein' soft-spoken
You got me broken, writing songs about you daily and it's messing with my focus
You fuck with him, but we both realized that he was bogus
I'm the one for you, so why do I feel like I go unnoticed
I'm talking more than clothes hittin' floors
I'm falling off track, but not the rack like a chore
Oh, look, another butterfly, I feel it in my core
Even though you ain't mine, it's the fact that I'm yours
It's the fact that my life ain't complete without yours
It's the fact that at night I be tryna ignore
Catching overseas flights just to knock on your door, 'cause
You put my planet in orbit
Stargirl, your body's so solar
Promise you, baby, I'm sober
Just wait 'til you give in and finally come over
I can't wait to tell you, "I told ya, I told ya, I told ya"

I'll practice my patience
While you're getting wasted (While you're getting wasted)
'Til fate brings you home
I'll wait through your phases
You'll shuffle through faces
Like songs in your playlist
'Til fate brings you home (Oh, oh)
I'll wait through your phases, phases

Let's go, oh!
I'll wait, I'll wait through your phases, phases, oh
(Girl, you know I'll wait for you)
I'll wait, I'll wait through your phases, phases
(I will wait through your phases)
For you, I'll wait through your phases, phases (Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
I'll wait, I'll wait
I'll wait through your phases, oh
