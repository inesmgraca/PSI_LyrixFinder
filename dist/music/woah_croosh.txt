 Lyrics:

Always in a lab like I'm tryin' cure cancer
Just been moving fast but I'm tryin' move it faster
Woah, lately the moneys been comin' in slow
But lately the ladies been lovin' the flow
I know they feelin' the Croosh
4 in the morning I'm still in the booth
Young insomniac, sleep is overrated
Where them thotties at, keep me motivated
Let em' in, bring em' in, tell em' bring a friend
Came up in the studio at fuckin' 3 A.M

Woah, stop. Wake up for the fetty
All I know is guap
Gotta keep it steady
On the road just watch, got me runnin' for the checks
I just put in work, got me feelin' like I'm next
Woah, stop. Wake up for the fetty
All I know is guap
Gotta keep it steady
On the road just watch, got me runnin' for the checks
I just put in work, got me feelin' like I'm next

I feel like I'm next but I could be wrong
We'll find the answers soon, trust me it shouldn't be long
They said I wouldn't belong, but I made this rap game my habitat
I'm up with the lions and tigers, why you still hangin' with alleycats
I'm out here evolving, I can't be complacent
A&R is calling, Phil told me be patient
Options, but never phase gotta earn the trust
You need me, I don't need you that's what I learned from Russ

Woah, stop. Wake up for the fetty
All I know is guap
Gotta keep it steady
On the road just watch, got me runnin' for the checks
I just put in work, got me feelin' like I'm next
Woah, stop. Wake up for the fetty
All I know is guap
Gotta keep it steady
On the road just watch, got me runnin' for the checks
I just put in work, got me feelin' like I'm next
