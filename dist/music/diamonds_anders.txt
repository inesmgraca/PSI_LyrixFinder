 Lyrics:

Yeah, she ain't got no time to spend on ya
Dressin' like she got nothin' to lose
Lookin' for a love, you ain't gon' find none
She don't want no love, she just want diamonds
Workin' like I got something to prove (to ya)
I ain't got no time to hate on you
OG told me always move in silence
I don't want no love, I just want diamonds

I just want fuck on yo bitch
I wanna fuck on yo bitch
I wanna teach her new tricks
I just might smash in the whip
And then go hit me a lick
Get the re-up, make it flip
Stay solid, never trip
Roll it up, take a hit
You know I just beat the case
Still I can’t go in the states
What a shame, what a shame
Still I’m out here runnin' game
You and I are not the same
And we will never be
She don’t wanna fuck with you
You should just let her be (Mmm)

She ain't got no time to spend on ya
Dressin' like she got nothin' to lose
Looking for a love, you ain't gon' find none
She don't want no love, she just want diamonds
Workin' like I got something to prove
I ain't got no time to spend on you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
OG told me always move in silence
I don't want no love I just want diamonds

I go to the plug and I finesse him for that work
She might bust it open and finesse him for a purse
I been goin' so hard I forget to go to sleep
I can’t give 'em one if they don’t wanna see me eat
But, I just wanna make hits
All hits, no miss
I don’t wanna be famous
I just wanna be rich
You the type to get paid
And spend it all on a bitch
I’m just only getting started
I ain’t worried 'bout shit
Same team, never switch
NST in this bitch
Fuck the game up, we a glitch
I could get used to this shit
You can find me on my way now
Going up, you can stay down
Everybody getting paid now (mmm)

She ain't got no time to spend on ya
Dressin' like she got nothing to lose
Looking for a love, you ain't gon' find none
She don't want no love, she just want diamonds
Workin' like I got something to prove
I ain't got no time to spend on you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
OG told me always move in silence
I don't want no love I just want diamonds

Diamonds
I don’t want no love I just want diamonds
Diamonds
I don’t want no love I just want diamonds
Diamonds
I don’t want no love I just want diamonds
Diamonds
I don’t want no love I just want diamonds
