 Lyrics:

Far outside, alright
Wanna see us fallin' overboard
You can come over, bring your best friend, let's head back to shore Woah, woah

Gimme something to forget
Everything she wanna beeline, right under her bed
All they want: the greens, we're too busy runnin' reds, honey is another step
I'm the man they never met
We in the lion's den, need it, we supply her
Rode the back of this Leviathan then to catch a wave
Had to break away, nothing else to save us too afraid to stay
Moby
Lock the ship below me
I can see your end, Nostradamus, good to know you
To those who came before me, we've come to raise sails, hell, whatever else, cut you by the tail, Yajirobe
In the maze way ahead of my time
Only got one shot to get it right, sight
Learn from me, sworn oath
More money, overdose

Far outside, alright
Wanna see us falling overboard
You can come over, bring your best friend, let's head back to shore

If you were in my stands, probably clock-out
When we make this music we don't watch what we talk 'bout
There's probably a reason that I went and took the long route
If not, wow
Gold diggin' got a stocked crew
Askin' for some love, ain't no way man that I asked you
Shady motherfuckers get cut, can't make the edit
'Specially when they leave your name out the ending credits
Karma come for you, bitch, and your whole life, regret it
Fuck we talkin', same vibes, you never had 'em, that's pathetic
I notice they just want me for the prize
It's hard for them to look me in the eye
Bitch, I'm fired up, me and Slip are groovin' down the aisle
Lookin' for the bad girl, nice smile (With a nice smile)
Yeah

Far outside, alright
Wanna see us falling overboard (That's overboard)
You can come over, bring your best friend, let's head back to shore

You're not special, you're not precious
